- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size
- Searches file contents using regular expressions
- Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+", etc.)
- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns file paths and line numbers with at least one match sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files containing EXACT or KNOWN text/patterns (e.g. a specific string literal, a known function name, a precise regex)
- If you need to identify/count the number of matches within files, use the Bash tool with `rg` (ripgrep) directly. Do NOT use `grep`.
- When you are doing an open-ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT use grep with complex OR-patterns (e.g. "\b(auth|login|token|...)\b") to find code by concept or purpose — use search_codebase instead, which understands code semantics and identifier structure
